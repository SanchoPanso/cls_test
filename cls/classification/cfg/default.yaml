### The main data storage for training
DATA:
  PATH: 'data_tmp_10122023' #'DATA'  # Absolute or relative path (if relative - repo dir is considered as root)
  
  # The following params are relative paths of subdirs (relative to 'path' value)
  datasets_dir: 'datasets'  # Subdir with json files that describe a dataset content for each group
  pictures_dir: 'pictures'  # Subdir with a common pool of image files
  meta_dir: 'meta'          # Subdir with metadata about picsets (each dir is like {group}/{picset}/*.json)
  models_dir: 'models'      # Subdir for training experiments that contains trained models (each experiment contains logs, checkpoints, models, etc)
  segments_dir: 'segments'  # Subdir for json files with image segmentation information (format: bbox - xyxy, segments - xyn)
  pictures_info_db_path: 'meta/pictures_info.db' # Path to sqlite database with pictures info


### A storage for testing results
TEST:
  PATH: 'TEST'  # Absolute or relative path (if relative - repo dir is considered as root)
  
  # The following params are relative paths of subdirs (relative to 'path' value)
  inference_dir: 'inference'  # Subdir for inference results


### A storage for temporary data that is used for marking up (e.g. for badlist creating) 
MARKUP: 
  PATH: 'MARKUP'  # Absolute or relative path (if relative - repo dir is considered as root)
  
  # The following params are relative paths of subdirs (relative to 'path' value)
  masks_dir: 'masks'  # Subdir for image masks

### A storage for  
PRODUCTION: 
  PATH: 'PRODUCTION'  # Absolute or relative path (if relative - repo dir is considered as root)
  

### Path to inference models for specific groups. Used for metadata building in `segment_meta_builder.py`
